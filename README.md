# dynamodbHi, the Status field is present in the spec and marked as required, but since it’s also marked as read-only, it doesn’t appear in the UI or Stoplight as an input field. This is expected behavior for read-only fields. Closing this ticket accordingly.
The Status field will remain marked as required since it is read-only, but please advise if any changes are expected from our side.
